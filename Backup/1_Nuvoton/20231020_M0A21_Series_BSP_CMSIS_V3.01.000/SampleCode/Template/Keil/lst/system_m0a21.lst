N     * |[11:8]  |SUSPITV   |Suspend Interval
N     * |        |          |This bit field provides the configurable suspend interval between two successive transmit/receive transaction in a transfer.
N     * |        |          |The definition of the suspend interval is the interval between the last clock edge of the preceding transaction word and the first clock edge of the following transaction word.
N     * |        |          |The default value is 0x3.
N     * |        |          |The period of the suspend interval is obtained according to the following equation.

N     * |        |          |Example:
N     * |        |          |SUSPITV = 0x0 ... 0.5 SPI_CLK clock cycle.
N     * |        |          |SUSPITV = 0x1 ... 1.5 SPI_CLK clock cycle.
N     * |        |          |...

N     * |        |          |Note: Changing the value of this bit field will produce the TXRST and RXRST to clear the TX/RX data buffer automatically.
N     * |[25:16] |SLVTOCNT  |Slave Mode Time-out Period
N     * |        |          |In Slave mode, this bit field is used for Slave time-out period.
N     * |        |          |This bit field indicates how many clock periods (selected by TMCNTSRC, USPI_BRGEN[5]) between the two edges of input SCLK will assert the Slave time-out event.
N     * |        |          |Writing 0x0 into this bit field will disable the Slave time-out function.
N     * |        |          |Example: Assume SLVTOCNT is 0x0A and TMCNTSRC (USPI_BRGEN[5]) is 1, it means the time-out event will occur if the state of SPI bus clock pin is not changed more than (10+1) periods of fDIV_CLK.
